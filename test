"Throughout the evaluation period, my commitment to embodying the firm's values has been evident through various meaningful initiatives that extend beyond my daily responsibilities. I actively participated in the hiring process by conducting multiple interviews, ensuring that the recruitment aligns with the firm's commitment to excellence. As a mentor, I provided support to 8 college-going girls from underprivileged communities, offering guidance in Data Structures/Algorithms through the NGO Catalyst, thereby contributing to diversity and inclusion.

In line with our commitment to social responsibility, I donated meal boxes to Angel's Orphanage, reflecting the firm's values of community service. Within the team, I took on a mentoring role, guiding junior members and conducting knowledge transfer sessions on development guidelines and tech stacks to enhance their understanding. Additionally, my involvement in the UI chapter sessions underscores my dedication to delivering a 'One Firm' approach by actively contributing to the knowledge-sharing culture within the organization. These actions collectively demonstrate my commitment to upholding and promoting the core values of the firm."
